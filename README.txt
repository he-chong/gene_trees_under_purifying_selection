This repository contains codes for studying the gene tree distribution under purifying selection.
The study includes two parts: simulation and empirical study. 

There are two versions of codes for the simulation. The results of these two versions are same.

The old version (Simulation/, python 2.7) was written in the period of 
the preparation of He et al Mol. Biol. Evol., 2020, 37:881-92

The new version (Simulation_new/, pythonn 3.7)was faster and costs less memmory. 
Meanwhile, the codes of the new version are clearer than the old version.
